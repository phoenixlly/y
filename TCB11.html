<p>In addition, <b>EREL may also enhance the Southwest Monsoon and bring occasional to monsoon rains over several areas of the country</b>
in the next three days. For more information, <b>refer to Weather Advisory No. 05</b> for Southwest Monsoon issued at 11:00 AM today. 
<br><br>Precipitation may be evident in the central section of the country, albeit with intermittent or occasional significance. It is imperative for
all stakeholders to diligently observe both the precipitation and the comprehensive advisories pertaining to heavy rainfall, as well as the
potential hazards and risks it may engender, disseminated by the esteemed divisions of CMAA. 

<br><br>Forecast rainfall are generally higher in elevated or mountainous areas. Under these conditions, flooding and rain-induced landslides are
possible, especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazard as identified in hazard maps and in localities that
experienced considerable amounts of rainfall for the past several days.</p>



        <p><strong><h3>Severe Winds:</h3></strong></p>
        <p><b>The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat</b> over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly
        stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the
        prevailing wind direction.</p>
        <p><b>Minor to moderate impacts </b>from gale-force winds are also possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 2.
        <b>Minimal to minor impacts </b> from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1. 
        <br><br>EREL and the enhanced southwest monsoon will continue to bring gusty conditions over the following areas not under any Wind Signal, especially in coastal or upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds:
        <br><br><b>TODAY through TOMORROW: </b>Aquamarine Island, V-Colorful, and Light Pink Region
        <br><br><b>MONDAY: </b>Sky Blue Region and V-Colorful</p>

        <p><strong><h3>HAZARD AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS:</h3></strong></p>
<p><b>TODAY:</b> EREL will bring rough to very rough seas (4.25 to 6.0 m) over the coastal waters along the seaboards of eastern Banana, eastern Avocado, Sandy Island, Flash Island, Spert Island, and Washington Island. Rough seas (4.0 to 4.5 m) over Banana and the rest
of Avocado, and Armstrong Island. Moderate to rough seas (2.75 to 4.0 m) along the seabaord of Black Current and Cranberry. 
<b>Mariners of motor bancas and similarly- sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if
possible, avoid navigating in these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels. </b>
<b><br><br>COASTAL INUNDATION:</b>
There is a high-risk of storm surge of up to 1.0 m in height which may cause flooding in the low-lying and exposed coastal areas of
Sandy Island, Flash Island, Washington Island, Armstrong Island, Spert Island, Fundle, Avocado, Black Current, Banana, and northern
Cranberry. For more information, refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 01 issued at 11:00 AM today.

        <p><strong><h3>TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK:</h3></strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>EREL maintain its strength and now at Sandy Strait. By today afternoon, this tropical storm is forecast to make a close approach over
            the Sandy Island and forecast to intensify prior to close approach. The forecast show that the strength of EREL during its close
            approach over Sandy Island is around 75 to 80 km/h. By the evening today, it will slowly move north before generally tracking the
            north-northeast direction.</li>
            <li>As the tropical storm begin moving to northeast, it is expected to further intensify while crossing the northern waters of the Colorful
            Sea. While moving towards the vicinity of Markitorawa Island in Sea, it is expected to be upgraded into Severe Tropical Storm. EREL
            is forecast to exit CAR Region by Monday.</li>

        necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards
        are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local CMAA Regional Services Division.
